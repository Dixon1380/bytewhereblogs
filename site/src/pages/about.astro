  <p>
    ByteWhere Labs is a systems-first lab focused on building AI-native
    infrastructure — not just apps on top of existing platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work here includes projects like ForgeKernel, ByteForce, and Pya —
    experiments in operating systems, automation, and intent-driven AI.
  </p>

  <p>
    This blog documents the thinking, failures, tradeoffs, and architecture
    behind those systems as they’re being built — not after they’re polished.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing here is “finished.” Everything is under construction.
    That’s the point.
