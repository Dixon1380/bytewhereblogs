# Why Root, Sudo, and Admin Privileges Are Outdated

The idea that one account should have unlimited power is not a feature.
It’s a design failure.

Root, sudo, and admin privileges were built for a world that doesn’t exist anymore. A world where systems were isolated, users were trusted, and “just don’t be dumb” was considered a security strategy.

Modern systems are networked, hostile, and constantly under social engineering attack. If your system still relies on a god account, your system is already broken.

As I design ForgeKernel, this is one of the first assumptions I’m throwing away.

## The Flaws of the Traditional Model

Root and admin accounts assume that:

* Some humans should permanently hold unlimited power
* Elevation is rare and safe
* Users always understand what they’re approving

None of that is true anymore.

Most real-world breaches don’t start with elite hackers breaking crypto. They start with:

* Someone clicking “yes”
* Someone running a script they don’t understand
* Someone pasting a command from a forum

If you can run it, malware can too.

Sudo doesn’t fix this. It just adds a password prompt before disaster.

The model itself is flawed: permanent power is too dangerous for modern systems.

## Why Incremental Fixes Aren’t Enough

RBAC and ABAC try to fix the problem by slicing god-mode into smaller pieces.

That’s better than nothing—but it still assumes someone should permanently hold power.

Roles, titles, departments—these are identity-based systems. They answer the wrong question.

The real question is not:

“Who are you?”

It’s:

“What exactly are you trying to do right now?”

ForgeKernel isn’t built around identity-based privilege. It’s built around capability-based execution.

## Designing a New Approach

In ForgeKernel, we’re exploring a capability-first model:

* No root account
* No sudo
* No permanent admin
* Only explicit, scoped permissions for specific actions

If something needs access, it asks for exactly that—nothing more.

Not a role.
Not a title.
Not a crown.

Capabilities are:

* Narrow
* Time-bound
* Action-specific

You don’t become powerful.
You are temporarily trusted to do one thing.

And when that thing is done, the power disappears.

This doesn’t eliminate social engineering—but it limits the blast radius. One bad click shouldn’t mean total system compromise.

## Builder Take

I believe root, sudo, and admin accounts are a design failure carried forward by habit.

They made sense when systems were small, isolated, and trusted.
They don’t make sense in a world of malware, phishing, and one-click installs.

I might be wrong about how far capability-based systems can scale.
I’m testing whether a kernel can enforce this model without becoming unusable.

Next, I’m prototyping capability enforcement directly in ForgeKernel’s core—so “god-mode” isn’t even possible.
