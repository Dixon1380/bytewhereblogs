## Games as Systems


Traditional AI-powered applications don't prepare us for the unique challenges of game development. Games require an understanding of game mechanics, simulation, and feedback loops to create engaging experiences. This is where Game Model Machine (GMM) comes in – a type of AI designed specifically for games.

GMM needs to grasp the underlying rules, simulation, and feedback loops that govern gameplay. It must learn from players' actions, adapt to new situations, and make decisions that drive gameplay forward. This requires GMM to operate within the context of a game's model, encompassing its mechanics, world, agents, and rules.

## Emergent Behavior


One key challenge in developing GMM is creating systems that can handle emergent behavior – where players' interactions produce unexpected outcomes used to inform gameplay. Games involve complex systems with multiple interacting components, making traditional AI approaches insufficient.

## Player Psychology


Players' expectations and emotions play a crucial role in game enjoyment; A long-term goal is for GMM to eventually reason about player behavior patterns and emotional signals—but that’s a hard, unsolved problem. This means developing an AI that understands player psychology, anticipates behavior, and makes decisions considering the emotional state of players.

## Architect's Perspective


I believe GMM is essential for creating engaging games. However, I'm exploring tradeoffs between adaptability and decision-making under uncertainty. One direction I’m exploring is how ideas like GMM could eventually sit on top of low-level systems like ForgeKernel—but that’s still design-stage, not reality yet. We're excited to see how GMM will change the way we approach game development and what new possibilities it will create for game builders like you.
