# What Intent Actually Means in AI Systems

As I’ve been designing Pya and ByteForce, I keep running into the idea of “intent” — and how loosely people use the word. It's easy to get caught up in oversimplifying it, but as I delve deeper, I realize just how complex intent can be.

Intent is often reduced to a single idea, but in reality, it depends on context and system architecture. When designing AI systems, we need to consider multiple perspectives and tradeoffs to truly understand intent.

## Task-Oriented Intent

Task-oriented intent focuses on completing specific tasks or sets of tasks. You might define success based on key performance indicators (KPIs) like accuracy or speed. For example, when designing a chatbot, task-oriented intent might prioritize completing customer inquiries efficiently and accurately.

## User-Centered Intent

User-centered intent prioritizes understanding what users want, their preferences, and constraints they face. System design choices can impact user experience; for instance, a user-friendly interface can enhance user satisfaction. When designing AI systems, it's crucial to balance competing demands from different stakeholders.

## System-Centric Intent

System-centric intent optimizes system performance, efficiency, or scalability. Are there specific system limitations that need to be worked around? For example, when building a cloud-based AI system, system-centric intent might prioritize scalability and reliability to ensure seamless processing of large data sets.

By examining these different perspectives on intent, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of what "intent" actually means in AI systems. As I think through Pya and prototype parts of it, I’m realizing how much intent shapes system behavior and outcomes. My next step is to explore the implications of intent on AI system architecture and design choices.
