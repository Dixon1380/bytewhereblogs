Why Static Schedulers Fail Under AI Workloads
=====================================================

I've been working on ForgeKernel, which aims to improve AI computing for systems builders. One of the main challenges we're facing is that static schedulers can't handle AI workloads effectively.

The issue with static schedulers lies in their reliance on predicting task execution times and dependencies upfront. However, AI workloads involve complex data flows and dependencies that are difficult to predict. They require dynamic allocation of resources and frequent re-evaluation of task priorities, which static schedulers can't adapt to.

How do complex data dependencies break static scheduling?
--------------------------------------------------------

AI workloads often involve unpredictable data flows and dependencies, making it challenging for static schedulers to determine the optimal schedule. Dynamic tasking requirements add complexity as tasks are spawned or terminated frequently based on performance metrics or other factors.

Real-world implications
----------------------

Running AI workloads on static scheduling infrastructures can lead to performance bottlenecks, errors, or system crashes. In our Pyact project, we've seen instances where AI models got stuck in infinite loops due to misprediction of task dependencies.

Next Steps
------------

We're actively developing adaptive and responsive scheduling algorithms tailored to AI workloads. We're also exploring ways to integrate domain-specific knowledge from AI experts into new scheduling architectures.

Builder Take
----------------

I currently believe that static schedulers are fundamentally incompatible with AI workloads. What I'm testing next is a novel approach to scheduling that combines domain-specific knowledge from AI experts with adaptive scheduling algorithms.

Looking forward to improving AI computing systems!
