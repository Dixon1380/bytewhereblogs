Why Containers Aren't Enough for AI-Native Systems
======================================================

I've been working on building robust and performant AI-native systems at ByteWhere Labs, and I've come to realize that containers alone aren't enough. While containerization provides isolation between applications, it doesn't address the unique memory and processing requirements of AI workloads.

## The Limits of Containers for AI Workloads

Containers are a great tool for packaging an application and its dependencies into a single unit. However, when it comes to AI-native systems, they fall short. AI models often require large amounts of memory and specialized hardware accelerators, which are difficult to containerize effectively. Experimenting with containers for AI workloads has shown me that they provide some benefits, such as isolation between applications. But ultimately, they fail to address the unique demands of these systems.

## The Need for a Holistic Approach

To build robust and performant AI-native systems, we need a more holistic approach that addresses specific needs. This means considering not only isolation but also performance, scalability, and reliability.

I'm currently exploring new architectures at ByteWhere Labs to handle the unique demands of AI workloads. I'm testing novel approaches to memory management, processing, and data movement to optimize performance and efficiency.

## Builder Take

As I see it, containers are a necessary step towards building robust AI-native systems but insufficient on their own. What I might be wrong about is underestimating containerization's ability to address AI workload demands.

Next, I'm testing a novel architecture that combines containerization with memory management and processing optimization techniques to build more robust and performant AI-native systems.

## Forward-Looking Build Intent

As we continue developing and testing new architectures for AI-native systems, my focus will be on building a comprehensive system that addresses these workloads' unique demands. I'm excited to see where this journey takes us and what innovations we can bring.
